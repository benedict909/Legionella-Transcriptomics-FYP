# Legionella-Transcriptomics-FYP

The waterborne bacterium _Legionella pneumophila_ is the aetiological agent of Legionnaireâ€™s disease, a severe type of pneumonia. To gain an understanding of its response to environmental stress, the transcriptomic response of _L. pneumophila_ to 9 stress conditions was investigated in an RNA-Sequencing differential expression analysis.
